About
=====

This code is aimed at providing node with a simlper interface for creating and hosting multiple websites.
Currently, the modules provided support HTTP, multiple hosts, and built-in cookie and session support.
It also natively supports parsing of HTML forms (www-form-data and multipart/form-data), i.e., file uploads.
HTTPS is not supported (yet!).

This is all highly untested code, so it is not gauranteed to work.

Installation
============

These are just plain [node modules][http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html] right now.  Eventually, I want to host this in an NPM repo for easy installation.
