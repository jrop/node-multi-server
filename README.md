About
=====

This code is aimed at providing node with a simlper interface for creating and hosting multiple websites.  Currently, the modules provided support HTTP, multiple hosts, and built-in cookie and session support.  HTTPS is not supported (yet!).

Installation
============

These are just plain [node modules][http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html] right now.  Eventually, I want to host this in an NPM repo for easy installation.
